        		<p class="lead font-alt">There is only three things that is required if you want to learn programming. And it is neither being good at mathematics or being smart although they would certainly make you learning process faster. These three skills go hand in hand.
The 3 things would be discussed fully at length</p>

	                    <h5 class="margin-bottom-0">PERSEVERANCE: </h5>
	                    <p class="text-muted">It is about <strong>perseverance</strong>. I am not going to sugar coat this. Learning programming well takes time and could . Even I, a senior developer, have days when it looks like I have accomplished nothing because I couldn’t figure out something at that particular time.  You need to be willing to keep on going in the face of difficulty. But you also need to be smart about this. And that is where the second important skill comes into play</p>

	                    <h5 class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>Ask Questions</strong></h5>
	                    <p class="text-muted">I cannot over emphasize this enough especially when learning programming. Do not be afraid to ask questions. It would save you man-hours because you would avoid going through the pains experts have already gone through. 
                        There are different ways of asking questions. 
                        With Google just a around the corner, think about what you are trying to do at that point and just Google it. Chances are 90% of the time you would find the solution to what you are 
                        looking for. 
                        Get in touch with other people learning to program with you. There is a saying that there is a saying that there is power in numbers. Chances are someone in your learning group has already figured out or gone through the question you are trying to ask.
                        </p>

		        	<div class="col-sm-12 icon-box icon-box-hover">
		            	<span class="icon icon-sm icon-circle icon-primary margin-bottom-20 animated" data-animation="bounceIn" data-animation-delay="600"><i class="fa fa-camera"></i></span>
		            	<h5 class="margin-bottom-0">CONFIDENCE THAT YOU WOULD EVENTUALLY BE GOOD AT PROGRAMMING.</h5>
		                <p class="text-muted">Finally, you should have the confidence that you would eventually know programming even when it looks daunting. That is one of the main difference between a novice programmer and an experienced programmer. He / She knows that they would figure out a solution to any problem he/she might be facing at the moment. That confidence is what would help you persevere.  Do not let anyone demoralize you or discourage you that you aren’t good enough. 
Applying this three things discussed above in your journey as a novice programmer would ultimately make you better. Ask any senior developer/programmer and they would ultimately arrive at the same conclusion. 
For programming to make sense to a beginner, you must have something you want to build that is simple. A to-do-list, GPA Calculator, etc. are examples of simple useful projects that you should embark on when learning programming. The reason for this is it would be more gratifying at the end and you would see how all the different topic you would be learning all come together in an actual application.
I sincerely wish you good luck as you begin your adventure with programming.
