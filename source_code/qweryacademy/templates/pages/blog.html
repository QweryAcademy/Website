                    <p class="lead font-alt">Nigeria like other developing countries has evolved to the point where school certificates obtained from higher institutions are not enough, you could have the best of grades from college and sure you would probably get a job after a while of searching but there is a high chance that you would be undervalued because quite frankly, it’s an employer’s market as the available spots are so limited and thousands of people are graduating every season (bagging BSc’s, MSc’s and PhD’s); so you’ll need the extra to be able to live that life where you don’t live from hand to mouth(you know how you get a salary and by the middle of the month you are already borrowing money and not because you are a spendthrift but just because it’s insufficient).</p>

                <p class="text-muted">The world of programming in Nigeria is an emerging market and has gotten to a point where basically everyone needs a programmer to develop something for them be it something as simple as a basic website to an e-commerce site, portfolio’s, regular business sites, social network sites e.tc. Or developing mobile applications or other softwares. Be it you or someone else, everyone needs a programmer to get things done. So it’s still at a stage where the demand is greater than the supply, which simply means <strong>capable</strong> programmers get paid well.</p>

The 3 things would be discussed fully at length.</p>
